# commonize-import-data

## About The Project
We have a number of different vendors, all of whom deliver product information in csv files with different fields.  In the past, we had different import strategies for each vendor. As the number of vendors increased, the work to support each on its own data pipeline became untenable. While our pipeline now is much more complex than this simple repo would indicate, the basics of data manipulation and mapping are still used.  

Despite being an older snippet of code, we thought this might be a useful starting point for others. The map files expose header information about 2 of our vendor data sources, but the data files have not been published.

## Ideas for You to Run With

1. Move the model outside of the primary script
2. Support different models at runtime
